# This script checks for any degraded/offline/failed/whatever software
# RAIDs, and if any are found emails a note to an admin.  To use it,
# replace the ADMIN_EMAIL value with your own email address, drop it in
# /etc/periodic/daily, and change the owner to root.  This'll make it
# run its check every morning at 3:15am.
#
# Warning: this script doesn't check anything other than software RAIDs
# built with the Apple (i.e. Disk Utility) RAID tools.  It does not check
# any hardware RAIDs (including Apple's RAID card), or even any third-party
# software RAIDs.  If "diskutil listraid" doesn't list it, it's not going
# to be checked.
